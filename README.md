# Torney-parody
A parody of the original Torney Progression Studios site
It took me about a month to complete this project.
This project has almost everthing a "baby web developer" needs to hone his skills.
It was a lot of fun and stress executing this project. It's not perfect but I'm happy at how it turned out
